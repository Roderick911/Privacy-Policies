This Privacy Policy describes how Stone Throw ("the Game," "we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and shares information when you use our Android game, Stone Throw. By downloading, installing, or using the Game, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

Information Collection and Use
1.1 No User Data Collection: Stone Throw does not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) or sensitive data from its users. We do not request or store any personal information such as names, email addresses, or contact details.

1.2 High Scores and Leaderboards: The Game utilizes Google Play Services to transmit and display high scores on online leaderboards. When you submit your high score, certain non-personal information, such as your game progress and achievements, may be collected and transmitted to Google Play Services. This information is used solely for the purpose of displaying high scores and improving the gaming experience.

AdMob Ad Services
2.1 AdMob and Personalized Ads: Stone Throw utilizes third-party ad services, such as AdMob, to display advertisements within the Game. These ad services may collect and use certain non-personal information, such as your device's advertising ID, to provide personalized ads and improve ad targeting. This information is generally anonymized and does not personally identify you.

2.2 Opt-out of Personalized Ads: If you do not wish to receive personalized ads, you can adjust your device settings or opt out using the settings provided by your operating system or Google. Please note that opting out of personalized ads does not mean you will no longer see any ads; it means that the ads you see may be less relevant to your interests.

Information Sharing
3.1 Third-Party Services: Stone Throw uses third-party services, such as Google Play Services and AdMob, for displaying advertisements and transmitting high scores for online leaderboards. These services may collect and use non-personal information as described in their respective privacy policies. We recommend reviewing the privacy policies of these third-party services for more information.

3.2 Legal Requirements: We may disclose information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., law enforcement agencies or regulatory bodies).

Data Security
We take reasonable measures to protect the information we receive and transmit. However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of any information you provide or transmit to us.

Children's Privacy
The Game is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us, and we will delete such information from our records.

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes we make will be posted within the Game, and the revised Privacy Policy will be effective immediately upon posting. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any updates.
